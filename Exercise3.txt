b) I literally copied the javascript code from the powerpoint to my .js document, and the code worked, so it was only the HTML that changed for this specific code, but it looks like there definitely is a functional difference between using an <input> and <button>. What is determined by a value in the input is in between the tags for a <button>. This might make it easier to change what is on the button using Javascript. More importantly, it expands what could be used as the "value" for a <button>. <button> can have more html than a string as a value. There could be a small image followed by a string, or more complicated CSS. CSS styling can be done with an <input type="button">, but it's a lot easier to deal with buttons on their own in CSS and there is some CSS that can be used to make the user feel more like the button shares some of the same elements as a link. That could be especially useful if the button will take the user to a new site.
